# Hi, I am Aayush 👋

I’m a graduate student pursuing Computer Science at NYU Tandon, passionate about building intelligent systems at the intersection of **AI, Machine Learning, and Full-Stack Engineering**.

My work spans across **deep learning**, **NLP**, and **computer vision**, and I’ve built and deployed projects ranging from a **distracted driver detection model** to an **AI-powered interview assistant** and a **resume analyzer using OpenAI APIs**. I’ve interned at organizations like **DRDO**, **Beahead Pvt Ltd**, **Clovity**, and currently contribute to **ZofAI** on cutting-edge AI safety tasks.

🚀 I love using cloud platforms (AWS, GCP), modern web stacks (Next.js, Flask, FastAPI), and tools like Hugging Face, PyTorch, and MongoDB to bring my ideas to life.

🔭 My current interests include:
- Large Language Models & Responsible AI
- FinTech + ML
- Chip Design Optimization with Graph Neural Networks
- Digital Twin Simulations for Semiconductor Manufacturing

🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on AI/ML research, production-grade full-stack apps, or tech-for-impact projects.

⚡ Fun fact: I don’t chase trends — I build what others debug, love prototyping fast, and have a habit of starting two projects at once (and finishing both 😄).
